# Offline-First Markdown Notes App

A React TypeScript application that allows users to create, edit, and manage Markdown notes with offline support and synchronization capabilities.

## Features

- **Offline-First**: Create and edit notes even when offline
- **Markdown Support**: Write notes in Markdown format with live preview
- **Auto-Save**: Changes are automatically saved with debounce (500ms)
- **Sync Status**: Visual indicators show sync status for each note
- **Search**: Filter notes by title or content
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Tech Stack

- React with TypeScript
- IndexedDB (via Dexie.js) for offline storage
- React Markdown for rendering Markdown content
- Axios for API requests
- JSON Server for mock backend API

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the mock API server

```bash
npm run server
```

3. In a new terminal, start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173

## Usage

- Click "New Note" to create a new note
- Click on a note in the sidebar to view or edit it
- Toggle between Edit and Preview modes using the button
- Notes are automatically saved as you type
- Search for notes using the search bar

## Offline Functionality

The app uses IndexedDB to store notes locally, allowing full functionality even when offline:

- Create, edit, and delete notes while offline
- Changes are automatically synced when online connectivity is restored
- Sync status indicators show the current state of each note:
  - üîÑ Unsynced: Changes haven't been synced to the server yet
  - ‚è≥ Syncing: Currently syncing with the server
  - ‚úÖ Synced: Successfully synced with the server
  - ‚ùå Error: Failed to sync with the server

## Design Decisions and Tradeoffs

### Offline-First Architecture

The app prioritizes local storage and operations, treating the server as a secondary sync target. This ensures the app remains fully functional regardless of network conditions.

### Conflict Resolution

A simple "last-write-wins" strategy is implemented for conflict resolution. When syncing, the most recently updated version of a note (based on timestamp) takes precedence.

### Sync Strategy

The app uses a debounced sync approach to prevent excessive API calls during rapid edits. Changes are synced 500ms after the last edit when online, or queued for sync when connectivity is restored.

## Testing Offline Mode

To test offline functionality:

1. Open the app while online
2. Use browser DevTools to simulate offline mode (Network tab ‚Üí Offline)
3. Create or edit notes
4. Switch back to online mode to observe synchronization
